# House-Price-Prediction
In the project, a robust multiple linear regression model was developed for predicting house prices using a carefully curated dataset from Kaggle. The process involved comprehensive exploratory data analysis, encompassing summary statistics, insightful visualizations, and meticulous preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and outliers. The model, trained and evaluated on distinct training and test sets, achieved a commendable R-squared of 0.55 on the test set. Key predictors, including living area, presence of a basement, and number of bathrooms, were identified through feature importance analysis

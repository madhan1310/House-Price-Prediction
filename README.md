# House-Price-Prediction
This project develops a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices based on attributes like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc. The model is trained on a dataset of housing data extracted from Kaggle. Extensive exploratory data analysis is conducted, including summary statistics, visualizations, and pre-processing steps like handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. The data is split into training and test sets to fit and evaluate the regression model. Feature importance analysis identifies the most significant predictors of house price. The final model achieves an R-squared of 0.55 on the test set and can be used by real estate professionals to estimate prices for new houses based on their characteristics. Key findings show living area, presence of basement, and number of bathrooms have the strongest correlation with house price.
